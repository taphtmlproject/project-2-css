        <dd class="c3">The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering has been providing Excellent Opportunities 
            for the students to explore & exhibit their academic , Co-curricular & Extra-curricular activities. I believe that 
            my team will help the students to graduate with flying colors and have a promising future.Electronics and 
            Communications Engineering (ECE Engineering) involves researching, designing, developing, and testing electronic 
            equipment used in various systems.Electronic engineering is a sub-discipline of electrical engineering which 
            emerged in the early 20th century and is distinguished by the additional use of active components such as semiconductor 
            devices to amplify and control electric current flow. Previously electrical engineering only used passive devices such 
            as mechanical switches, resistors, inductors, and capacitors.</dd>

        <dd class="c8">Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and 
            application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. 
            It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the 
            electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.Electrical engineers design,
            develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation 
            systems, communications systems, or power generation equipment. Electrical engineers also design the electrical systems
            of automobiles and aircraft.</dd>
